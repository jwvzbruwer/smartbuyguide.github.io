Here are some key factors to consider:</p>\n<h3>1. Performance</h3>\n<p>Look for laptops with at least an Intel Core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3 processor. These provide sufficient power for everyday tasks like web browsing, document editing, and video streaming.</p>\n<h3>2. RAM</h3>\n<p>A minimum of 8GB of RAM is recommended for smooth multitasking. This ensures that you can run multiple applications without lag, especially during online classes or while working on assignments.</p>\n<h3>3. Battery Life</h3>\n<p>Students are often on the go, so a laptop with a long battery life is essential. Aim for a device that can last at least 8 hours on a single charge.</p>\n<h3>4. Display</h3>\n<p>A full HD display (1920 x 1080 resolution) provides a better viewing experience, making it easier to read text and watch videos.</p>\n<h3>5. Portability</h3>\n<p>Consider the weight and size of the laptop.
